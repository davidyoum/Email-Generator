## Email Generator

A simple python email generator that uses .json files. 
In the future when I have more knowledge, I would like to make it a lot more complicated so you cant tell if the emails are real or fake.

I just have so its
`FirstName + LastName + (A Random Number from 0~999) + Email Domain`

Nothing much and whipped it up in a few. Had to look things up since my first time working with .json.
